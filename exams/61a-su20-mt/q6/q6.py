    Write a function `copycat` that takes in two lists.

        `lst2` is a list of integers

    It returns a new list where every element from `lst1` is copied the
    number of times as the corresponding element in `lst2`. If the number

    any extra elements in the longer list.

    Note 2: you can assume that you will never be asked to delete more
